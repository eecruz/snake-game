# SNAKE

## What is this?
This is my implementation of the game snake.

Written in java for extra practice, followed tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ

## How to run this game?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java.

I recommend using an IDE such as Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the SnakeGame.java file.
